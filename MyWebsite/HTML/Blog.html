                  <p>Creating my personal website was an exciting and challenging endeavor that allowed me to showcase my professional experience and skills as an audio technician and an IT student. The website is designed to provide potential employers with a comprehensive overview of my qualifications and work history, while also sharing my knowledge and thoughts on the field of audio and sound production
                  </p>
                  <p>The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was deployed using a hosting service. I started by sketching out a wireframe and identifying the key features and pages that I wanted to include. From there, I designed the website layout using CSS and incorporated interactive elements using JavaScript.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the process, I encountered several challenges, such as ensuring that the website was optimized for different screen sizes and resolving cross-browser compatibility issues. However, these challenges allowed me to develop my skills and gain a deeper understanding of web development principles.</p>

                    For the Kingdomwork project, I am working on implementing a remote access solution to enable a mixing engineer to attend a session remotely. I am currently exploring the use of remote desktop technology, such as Splashtop, which allows remote control of a computer over the internet. This will allow the mixing engineer to access the computer that is connected to the recording systems at the studio, from anywhere in the world. With this technology, the mixing engineer will be able to adjust the levels, EQ, and other parameters in real-time, just as if they were sitting in the studio, providing a seamless experience for the recording team.
                  </p><p>
                    In addition, I am also exploring the use of wifi cameras for two-way communication during remote sessions. By setting up a wifi camera in the control room, the remote mixing engineer will be able to see and hear what is happening in the studio, and communicate with the musicians or producers in real-time. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the recording process is as efficient as possible.
                  </p><p>
                    Overall, I believe that these remote access and communication solutions will be a game-changer for the Kingdomwork project, and will allow us to work with clients from anywhere in the world, while still maintaining the high-quality standards that we are known for. While the implementation of these solutions may require some technical expertise and troubleshooting, I am excited to take on this challenge and to continue learning and growing my skills as an audio technician and IT professional.
