          As a seasoned theatre technician, I have provided sound design services for numerous productions, including both musicals and plays. My experience ranges from intimate black box theaters to large-scale productions on grand stages. I have a keen ear for creating soundscapes that perfectly complement the performances on stage, and I'm skilled in using industry-standard software to produce high-quality sound.
          <br><br>With years of experience working as a live sound technician, I have gained the expertise required to deliver high-quality sound at any type of event. I have worked on concerts, music festivals, corporate events, and more, and I always strive to ensure that the sound is crystal clear and perfectly balanced. Whether you need me to mix sound for a small band or a large orchestra, I have the skills and experience required to deliver exceptional results.
          <br><br>When KingdomworK Studio, a local recording studio, was destroyed by a flood, I was brought in to help rebuild the systems from the ground up. I collaborated with other technicians to design and build a state-of-the-art recording system that features the latest technology and equipment. Today, KingdomworK Studio is a thriving recording space that has helped to produce excellent music.
          <br><br>In my free time, I enjoy working on my own audio projects in my home studio. I use my skills and knowledge to produce high-quality recordings that sound professional and polished. My home studio is equipped with the latest technology, including industry-standard microphones and digital audio workstations. Whether I'm producing music or recording voiceovers, I always strive to achieve the highest quality sound possible.
          <br><br>As an IT student, I have worked on several projects that have allowed me to apply my technical skills and knowledge in a practical way. For example, I worked on a project that involved developing a new website for a local business. I also worked on a project that involved setting up a new computer network for a non-profit organization. These projects have given me the opportunity to hone my skills in web development, network administration, and other areas of IT.
